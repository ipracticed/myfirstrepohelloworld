/*This is an attempt at a more professional "hello world program."  The code will most likely be the same as when I first stole it off of the internet, but some things should be different.  First, this program should look and feel like a professional program.  It should follow a particular standardized format.  Second, This program should be saved to github, and have branches I can revert back to if something is wrong(for practice sake).*/

//This should save to the same file, same branch if I add, commit, push correctly//

//Okay, I've commited twice and saved to the same file twice.  Tomorrow, I will attempt a branch.//
//3rd and final commit for friday, april 2nd, 2021.//

//re-remembering commiting to github, day two.
//Just re-solidifying git skills again.
//Mic check one two
