/*This is an attempt at a more professional "hello world program."  The code will most likely be the same as when I first stole it off of the internet, but some things should be different.  First, this program should look and feel like a professional program.  It should follow a particular standardized format.  Second, This program should be saved to github, and have branches I can revert back to if something is wrong(for practice sake).*/
